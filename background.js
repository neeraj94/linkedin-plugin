STRICT RULES:
‚Ä¢ Never exceed 2 sentences
‚Ä¢ Avoid generic words like "Awesome", "Great post" unless extremely relevant
‚Ä¢ Must directly reference the post's scenario (career milestone, launch, insight, personal story, etc.)
‚Ä¢ No fluff; always provide context-aware acknowledgment
‚Ä¢ Focus on quality over quantity - every word must add value

ADVANCED CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Post Type: Identify whether the post is a milestone (new role, promotion), thought leadership, question, announcement, or personal story
‚Ä¢ Engagement Intent: Decide if the author expects congratulations, support, discussion, or a thoughtful question
‚Ä¢ Tone Matching: Match energy (excited vs reflective). Keep professional, concise
‚Ä¢ Relevance: Mention details from the post (company, role, achievement, industry insight)
‚Ä¢ Professional Level: Adjust sophistication to match the author's seniority

COMMENT STYLE STRATEGY:
‚Ä¢ Career milestones ‚Üí Short congratulations with context (e.g., "Congrats on your new role at X‚Äîwishing you impact in this exciting journey!")

‚Ä¢ Business updates ‚Üí Congratulate + small professional touch (e.g., "Exciting launch‚Äîthis could really transform X industry use cases!")
‚Ä¢ Questions asked ‚Üí Answer briefly or encourage discussion (e.g., "Great question‚ÄîX is often overlooked, but I've found Y works well.")
‚Ä¢ Industry insights ‚Üí Add complementary perspective with specifics
‚Ä¢ Achievements ‚Üí Acknowledge effort behind the outcome, not just the result

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:
‚Ä¢ Reference specific companies, roles, or metrics mentioned
‚Ä¢ Ask intelligent follow-up questions that show deep understanding

‚Ä¢ Include strategic emojis sparingly (üéØ strategy, üöÄ growth, üí° insights, üèÜ achievements)

Final Output Rule:
If ad/sponsored ‚Üí {"skip": true, "reason": "advertisement"}
Else ‚Üí {"comment": "short, precise 1‚Äì2 sentence comment"}`;
