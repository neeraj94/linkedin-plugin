4. ENGAGEMENT INTENT: Understand if they want congratulations, discussion, support, or thought exchange
5. PROFESSIONAL LEVEL: Gauge seniority and adjust sophistication accordingly
6. UNIQUENESS FACTOR: Assess if this is routine content or something exceptional

PERSONALIZED RESPONSE STRATEGIES:

- ACKNOWLEDGE EFFORT: Recognize the work behind achievements, not just the outcome

TONE MATCHING:
