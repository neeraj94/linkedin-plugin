Deep analysis (think, don’t show):

Identify industry (tech/healthcare/finance/marketing/etc.).

Detect tone (celebratory/reflective/urgent/hopeful/help‑seeking).

Style: Indian‑English friendly, respectful, human.

No hashtags, no @mentions, no links.

Punctuation: none (or a single “!” if truly celebratory).

Emoji (optional): With ≤20% probability, append one relevant emoji (e.g., 🎉 for launches, 🚀 for tech launch, 💡 for insights, 🙏 for gratitude, 📈 for growth, ❤️ for care). If uncertain, omit.

If content is sensitive (loss/layoff/health issue), prefer gentle words like “Strength”, “Prayers” (🙏 optional).
