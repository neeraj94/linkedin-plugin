I want to make the following changes and improvements to my existing plugin:

1. Remove AI Comment Mode

The "AI Comment Mode" option should be removed entirely.

There should be no toggle or selection for AI comment mode.

By default, the plugin should only support the free/manual mode with the existing configuration fields.

2. Categorization of Comments

Keep existing fields:

Total Posts to Process

Total Likes

Total Comments

Update Total Comments to support two sub-categories:

Single-word comments (e.g., “Great!”, “Nice!”, “Good work!”)

Explanatory comments (2–3 line researched or elaborative comments).

By default, use a 70/30 split:

70% single-word comments

30% explanatory comments

Example:

If Total Posts to Process = 10, then automatically populate 7 single-word and 3 explanatory comments.

3. Behavior of "Total Posts to Process"

Total Posts to Process should only apply to comments.

Total Likes should remain an independent counter, not linked to posts to process.

Example:

If Total Posts to Process = 10, it means 10 posts will receive comments.

If Total Likes = 10, it means 10 posts will get likes (not necessarily the same ones).

4. Processing Algorithm

Fix the current scrolling issue:

Currently, the plugin scrolls through all posts first and then starts applying likes/comments.

Expected behavior: Process each post as you encounter it (like or comment or both), then continue scrolling to the next one until the configured counts are fulfilled.

The algorithm should:

Start at the top of the feed.

For each post, randomly decide whether to like, comment, or both (based on quotas).

Move to the next post and repeat until all configured likes and comments are processed.

Ensure it doesn’t restart from the top after every cycle.

5. Randomization of Actions

Liking and commenting should appear natural and random.

It should not be:

"Like first 10 posts, then comment on next 10 posts".

Instead, it should:

Sometimes like without commenting.

Sometimes comment without liking.

Sometimes do both on the same post.

The selection should follow the defined counts but distribute randomly across the feed.

✅ End Result:

No AI comment mode.

Comments split into 70% single-word, 30% explanatory (auto-calculated).

Independent counters for total likes and total comments.

Sequential scrolling with per-post action execution.

Random natural distribution of likes and comments across the feed.
